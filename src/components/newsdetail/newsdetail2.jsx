                    (FEB) Universitas Brawijaya (UB) succeeded in winning the
                    won the Silver Medal in the field of Mechanical and
                    Electrical Engineering at the International Invention
                    Competition for Young Moslem Scientist 2022. (IICYMS 2022)
                    which was held on 29 May - 14 June 2022, organized by the
                    Indonesian Young Scientists Association. Indonesian Young
                    Scientists Association (IYSA) in collaboration with State
                    Islamic University (UIN) (UIN) Gunung Jati Bandung, IICYMS
                    2022 was attended by 114 participants from 9 countries such
                    as Thailand, Malaysia, India, Iran, Turkey, Macedonia,

                    The UB team consisted of Fitri Ayu Asyari (FT), Narista
                    Rahma Fadila (FT), Adelia Raihana Nabilah Firdausi (F-MIPA),
                    Noor Adi Sukma (FEB), Gilang Hans Arthana (FEB) with
                    lecturers Astuteryanti Tri Lustyana, ST. In the final round
                    they presented their work "Future Vehicle Concept with the
                    Use of Lithium Metal from Lapindo Sidoarjo". "We present a
                    vehicle concept design that is more environmentally
                    friendly. environment. LIDO electric motorcycle or an
                    acronym for Lapindo mud electric motorcycle," said team

                    The Industrial Engineering student added that the LIDO
                    electric motor is a motor that utilizes batteries from
                    Lapindo Mud Rare Earth Metal (LTJ), which is lithium which
                    is needed for the development of electric motors and
                    Bruslesh Direct Current (BLDC) dynamo to channel electrical
                    energy to the battery as a substitute for fuel. electrical
                    energy to the battery as a substitute for fuel. "By
                    utilizing LTJ as a battery, it will certainly be able to
                    help utilize Lapindo mud that was previously only moved
                    around to be more useful. Where after researched, there is a
                    fairly high LTJ content in the form of lithium," added the
                    student from Jombang. Then the The LIDO electric motor also
                    uses a BLDC dynamo to help supply the supply energy needs
                    when the engine is working. In the future, electric vehicles
                    will lead to the concept of vehicles that are
                    energy-efficient and environmentally friendly. "During this
                    competition, we are very excited because this is our our
                    first international competition," Fitri said regarding the
                    experience of competing. Fitri admitted that her team also
                    saw many cool ideas from other participants, but that did
                    not discourage them because they had discouraged them
                    because they had prepared the best idea from the team.
                    "During the presentation, we also got input and insight from
                    the judges regarding our ideas related to future
                    development," said Fitri. Fitri. related to future
                    development. Overall Overall, we are very happy to have won
                    the silver medal and had an unforgettable experience,
                    experience," she concluded.
